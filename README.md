### Report on the Python Programs for Data Analysis and Linear Regression:

*** Introduction:

In this report, we analyze a Python program designed for data analysis using the pandas library and visualization with matplotlib and seaborn. The main focus 
is on exploring the relationship between hours studied and scores obtained, culminating in a linear regression model to predict scores based on study hours.

 *** Data Loading and Exploration:
 
The program begins by importing necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`) and loading a dataset named "score.csv" 
using `pd.read_csv()`.Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the dataset:
- **Shape:** The dataset consists of `df.shape[0]` rows and `df.shape[1]` columns.
- **Description:** `df.describe()` provides summary statistics like count, mean, min, max, etc., for numeric columns.
- **Info:** `df.info()` gives information about the dataset including column names and data types.

 *** Data Preparation:

Next, the data is prepared for modeling:
- **Independent Variable (x):** Hours studied (`df["Hours"]`), reshaped into a 2D array (`x = df.Hours.values.reshape(-1, 1)`).
- **Dependent Variable (y):** Scores obtained (`df["Scores"]`), reshaped similarly (`y = df.Scores.values.reshape(-1, 1)`).
- **Train-Test Split:** Using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`, the dataset is split into training and testing sets (`x_train`, `x_test`,
  `y_train`, `y_test`).

*** Linear Regression Modeling:

A simple linear regression model is implemented using `LinearRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`:
- **Model Training:** `reg_1.fit(x_test, y_test)` trains the model on the training data.
- **Model Evaluation:** `reg_1.score(x_test, y_test)` computes the R-squared score of the model.
- **Coefficients and Intercept:** `reg_1.coef_` gives the slope coefficient(s) of the model, and `reg_1.intercept_` provides the intercept.

*** Visualization:

Two types of visualizations are employed to understand the relationship between hours studied and scores obtained:
- **Scatter Plot:** `plt.scatter(df["Hours"], df["Scores"], color="r", marker="*")` with a regression line plotted using `plt.plot(df["Hours"], y_pred,
  color="b")`.
- **Seaborn Scatter Plot:** `sns.scatterplot(data=df, x="Hours", y="Scores", hue="Hours", marker="^")`.

 *** Conclusion:

This Python program effectively demonstrates the process of:
- Loading and exploring a dataset (`score.csv`).
- Preparing data for machine learning tasks using `pandas` and `numpy`.
- Implementing a linear regression model using `sklearn`.
- Visualizing the relationship between variables using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

The results of the linear regression model suggest a positive correlation between hours studied and scores obtained, as indicated by the coefficient and 
visualizations. Further analysis or refinement of the model could involve assessing its assumptions, checking for multicollinearity, or exploring alternative
regression techniques depending on the dataset's characteristics and goals.

Overall, this program provides a solid foundation for conducting data analysis and building predictive models using Python libraries, contributing to insights
into educational outcomes based on study habits.
